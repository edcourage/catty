## Catty

Give me cats!

### Set Up

- `npm install`


### Thought Log

I've set up Next JS and it currently returns Hello World locally. I've also set up my testing frameworks (Jest, Enzyme, Cypress). I currently don't have any tests... so i can remind myself how to use use this tech stack I'm not going to TDD for the first feature (show random cat on page). Once I have an simple API GET request working I shall, write the tests.
