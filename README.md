### Thought Log

 - I've set up Next JS, and it currently returns Hello World locally. I've also set up my testing frameworks (Jest, Enzyme, Cypress). So I can remind myself how to use this tech stack I'm not going to TDD for the first feature (show random cat on the home page). Once I have a simple API GET request working, I shall write the tests.
 - I now get random cats on the home page using a straightforward API call. I also have a few tests using Jest and Enzyme. The next step is setting up Cypress. If I had more time!... I could now start building my search by breeds page. Because I've laid a strong foundation, I now have an excellent picture of how I would start implementing some slightly more exciting features!
